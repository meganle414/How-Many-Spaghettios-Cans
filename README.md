# How-Many-Spaghettios-Cans

I saw a TikTok where someone made a program in Java to figure out how many Spaghettio-s cans you need to make a script from a certain movie and I wanted to make one too in Python!

Enter in the number of letters you have in one can from A-Z, separated by spaces and this program will figure out about how many Spaghettios cans you need to write the text file entirely in Spaghettios. My text file is the Bee Movie script, but you can change the text file to whatever!
